## Angular Directives

Angular directions are classes that added certain behaviors to your app's elements

# Component  Directives
Directives that are essentially a custom element with its own view and behavior. Every angular component is a directive with a template.
# Structural Directives
Directives that alter the layout of the dom by adding or removing an element (nglf, ngFor, ngSwitch) [for newer angular vers, we use @If, @For, and @Switch]
@If - Render element based on a Boolean Value
@For - repeats an element for each item in a collection
@Switch display one of a set of elements based on a matching criteria
# Attribute Directives
Directives that change the appearance/behavior of an element/component/directive. (ngClass, ngStyle)
